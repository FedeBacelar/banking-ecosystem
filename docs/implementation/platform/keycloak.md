# Keycloak Implementation

Keycloak is the current local identity provider infrastructure.

It is a platform component. It does not own banking business data.

## Current Status

Implemented as local infrastructure.

Current capabilities:

- Runs Keycloak in development mode.
- Exposes the Keycloak admin console locally.
- Persists local Keycloak data in a Docker volume.
- Supports local override of port and admin credentials through environment variables.

## Local Runtime

Default HTTP port:

```txt
8090
```

Admin console:

```txt
http://localhost:8090
```

## Configuration

Docker Compose file:

```txt
infra/keycloak/docker-compose.yml
```

Local environment example:

```txt
infra/keycloak/.env.example
```

## Start

```powershell
docker compose -f infra/keycloak/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## Stop

```powershell
docker compose -f infra/keycloak/docker-compose.yml down
```

## Current Limitations

No realm, client, users, roles, or gateway security rules are defined yet.

Those items belong to the next security features.
